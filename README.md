# Blogins

Welcome to Blogins. Blogins is going to be a website for users to create articles for others to read. Articles can be whatever they want, for example, news articles, blog pos or cooking recipes.

Technologies utilized so far:
* TypeScript
* React
* Next.js
* Graphql
* PostgreSQL
* MikroORM
  
The main idea behind this project is to learn something new and challange me to create a bit more coplex program. 

### Stay tuned for more!
